// Node-oriented background script preserved for tooling and local scripts.
// NOTE: This is NOT used by the Chrome extension runtime. The extension's
// service worker lives at extension/background.js.

// ...original background.js content (Node/tooling copy)
// Use this file only in Node tasks; do not load this file in Chrome.

/*
Paste or keep a copy of the original background script here if you need it
for Node-based tooling. This placeholder prevents accidental loading by
Chrome when users select the repository root for Load unpacked.
